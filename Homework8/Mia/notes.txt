reader

read if there is a new value available

writer

can write if less or equal to other value
initialize both released


for reading

server holds semaphore
releases it when value changes
reader gets the new value

first do a version with one semaphore for every read/write

then a version where there is one for each memory object (no conditions)

then use one with a general one for rw access with extra for read/write conditions
